# Concepts of Programming Languages Class

This was meant to be a full collection of all of the assignments and projects I have completed for this class, but the hard drive that had all the work for this class and several others, crashed (It was 9 years old). All of the work was stored locally, and there are no other backups online. I know - rookie mistake.

This is an incomplete collection of some of the assignments and projects I completed for this class. I had only thought about saving and putting these assignments on GitHub at a later date, so I do not have many of the earlier assignments.

The textbook we used is [Concepts of Programming Languages by Robert Sebesta](https://www.amazon.com/Concepts-Programming-Languages-Robert-Sebesta/dp/013394302X)
