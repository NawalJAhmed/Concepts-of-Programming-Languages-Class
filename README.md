# Concepts of Programming Languages Class

This was meant to be a full collection of all of the assignments and projects I have completed for this class, but the hard drive that had all the work for this class and several others, crashed (It was 9 years old). All of the work was stored locally, and there are no other backups online. I know - rookie mistake.

This is the only assignment that I had from a USB drive. :(

The textbook we used is [Concepts of Programming Languages by Robert Sebesta](https://www.amazon.com/Concepts-Programming-Languages-Robert-Sebesta/dp/013394302X)

It is public so future students can use it to understand assignments they may have trouble on, but please do not use it to cheat.
